# Assembly6

This code is from a lab that I completed in my Systems Fundamentals class. 
My tasks included painting a background a certain color based off input from the user giving number values from 0-255 for Red, Green, and Blue.
I also had to draw a line on that background given two (x,y) coordinates, and a triangle after that based on three (x,y) coordinates.

This was all coded in MIPS Assembly language.
